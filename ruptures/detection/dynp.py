Exact segmentation: dynamic programming
====================================================================================================

Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The method is implemented in :class:`ruptures.detection.Dynp`.

Roughly speaking, it computes the cost of all subsequences of a given signal.
The number of computed costs is of the order :math:`\mathcal{O}(Kn^2)`, where :math:`K` is the number
of change points and :math:`n` the number of samples.
This has to be multiplied by the computational cost of computing the approximation error on one
sub-sequence.
Consequently, piecewise constant models are significantly faster than linear or autoregressive
models.

Computational cost is drastically reduced when considering only a subsample of possible change
points.
When calling :meth:`ruptures.detection.Dynp.__init__`, the minimum distance between change points
can be set through the keyword ``'min_size'``; through the parameter ``'jump'``, only change
point indexes multiple of a particular value are considered.


Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pylab as plt
    import ruptures as rpt

    # creation of data
    n, dim = 500, 3
    n_bkps, sigma = 3, 5
    signal, bkps = rpt.pw_constant(n, dim, n_bkps, noise_std=sigma)

    # change point detection
    model = "l1"  # "l2", "rbf"
    algo = rpt.Dynp(model=model, min_size=3, jump=5).fit(signal)
    my_bkps = algo.predict(n_bkps=3)

    # show results
    rpt.show.display(signal, bkps, my_bkps, figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.show()
