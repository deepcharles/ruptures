Bottom-up segmentation
====================================================================================================

Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bottom-up change point detection is used to perform fast signal segmentation and is implemented in
:class:`ruptures.detection.BottomUp`.
It is a sequential approach.
Contrary to binary segmentation, which is a greedy procedure, bottom-up segmentation is generous:
it starts with many change points and successively deletes the less significant ones.
First, the signal is divided in many sub-signals along a regular grid.
Then contiguous segments are successively merged according to a measure of how similar they are.
See for instance :cite:`bu-Keogh2001` or :cite:`bu-Fryzlewicz2007` for an algorithmic
analysis of :class:`ruptures.detection.BottomUp`.
The benefits of bottom-up segmentation includes low complexity (of the order of
:math:`\mathcal{O}(n\log n)`, where :math:`n` is the number of samples), the fact that it can extend
any single change point detection method to detect multiple changes points and that it can work
whether the number of regimes is known beforehand or not.

Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Start with the usual imports and create a signal.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pylab as plt
    import ruptures as rpt
    # creation of data
    n, dim = 500, 3  # number of samples, dimension
    n_bkps, sigma = 3, 5  # number of change points, noise standart deviation
    signal, bkps = rpt.pw_constant(n, dim, n_bkps, noise_std=sigma)

To perform a bottom-up segmentation of a signal, initialize a :class:`ruptures.detection.BottomUp`
instance.

.. code-block:: python

    # change point detection
    model = "l2"  # "l1", "rbf", "linear", "normal", "ar"
    algo = rpt.BottomUp(model=model).fit(signal)
    my_bkps = algo.predict(n_bkps=3)

    # show results
    rpt.show.display(signal, bkps, my_bkps, figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.show()

In the situation in which the number of change points is unknown, one can specify a penalty using
the ``'pen'`` parameter or a threshold on the residual norm using ``'epsilon'``.

.. code-block:: python

    my_bkps = algo.predict(pen=np.log(n)*dim*sigma**2)
    # or
    my_bkps = algo.predict(epsilon=3*n*sigma**2)

.. seealso:: :ref:`sec-general-formulation` for more information about stopping rules of sequential algorithms.

For faster predictions, one can modify the ``'jump'`` parameter during initialization.
The higher it is, the faster the prediction is achieved (at the expense of precision).

.. code-block:: python

    algo = rpt.BottomUp(model=model, jump=10).fit(signal)
