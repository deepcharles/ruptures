First, a generalisation of the Hajek-Renyi inequality, dealing with the uctuations of the normalized partial sums, is given. This preliminary result is then used to derive the consistency and the rate of convergence of the change-points estimate, in the situation where the number of changes is known. Strong consistency is obtained under some mixing conditions. The limiting distribution is also computed under an invariance principle. The case where the number of changes is unknown is then addressed. All these results apply to a large class of dependent processes, including strongly mixing and also long-range dependent processes.},

More specifically, we aim at detecting changes in speed and in incline by analyzing the accelerometer signals recorded on the shin or the waist of the walker. The raw accelerometer signals are transformed either in the time-frequency domain (with a Short-Time Fourier Transform) or in a specific features space (which emphasizes the characteristics of the gait). The transformed signals serve as inputs for change-point detection methods which output a number of estimated change times. Several change-point detection methods are tested, either parametric or non-parametric. In particular, a new change-point detection method is introduced, which takes into account the frequency structure of walking signals. The different signal representations and change-points detection methods are evaluated on a corpus of 24 subjects. An analysis of the obtained results is presented for the two considered sensors (waist and shin).},

These probes are genomic DNA sequences (BACs) that are mapped on the genome. The signal has a spatial coherence that can be handled by specific statistical tools. Segmentation methods seem to be a natural framework for this purpose. A CGH profile can be viewed as a succession of segments that represent homogeneous regions in the genome whose BACs share the same relative copy number on average. We model a CGH profile by a random Gaussian process whose distribution parameters are affected by abrupt changes at unknown coordinates. Two major problems arise : to determine which parameters are affected by the abrupt changes (the mean and the variance, or the mean only), and the selection of the number of segments in the profile.},

The model takes the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well as the parameters associated with each one (product degree and knot locations) are automatically determined by the data. This procedure is motivated by the recursive partitioning approach to regression and shares its attractive properties. Unlike recursive partitioning, however, this method produces continuous models with continuous derivatives. It has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few variables. In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately identifies the additive contributions and those associated with the different multivariable interactions.},

The class of models assumes independence between the posterior distribution of the parameters associated with segments of data between successive changepoints. This approach is based on the use of recursions, and is related to work on product partition models. The computational complexity of the approach is quadratic in the number of observations, but an approximate version, which introduces negligible error, and whose computational cost is roughly linear in the number of observations, is also possible. Our approach can be useful, for example within an MCMC algorithm, even when the independence assumptions do not hold. We demonstrate our approach on coal-mining disaster data and on well-log data. Our method can cope with a range of models, and exact simulation from the posterior distribution is possible in a matter of minutes.},

abstract = {In the analysis of data generated by change-point processes, one critical challenge is to determine the number of change-points. The classic Bayes information criterion (BIC) statistic does not work well here because of irregularities in the likelihood function. By asymptotic approximation of the Bayes factor, we derive a modified BIC for the model of Brownian motion with changing drift. The modified BIC is similar to the classic BIC in the sense that the first term consists of the log likelihood, but it differs in the terms that penalize for model dimension. As an example of application, this new statistic is used to analyze array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) data. Array-CGH measures the number of chromosome copies at each genome location of a cell sample, and is useful for finding the regions of genome deletion and amplification in tumor cells. The modified BIC performs well compared to existing methods in accurately choosing the number of regions of changed copy number. Unlike existing methods, it does not rely on tuning parameters or intensive computing. Thus it is impartial and easier to understand and to use.},

Our method consists of a data reduction stage based on record filtering, followed by a nonparametric change-point detection test based on {\$}U{\$}-statistics. Using this approach, we can address massive data streams and perform anomaly detection and localization on the fly. We show how it applies to some real Internet traffic provided by France-T$\backslash$'el$\backslash$'ecom (a French Internet service provider) in the framework of the ANR-RNRT OSCAR project. This approach is very attractive since it benefits from a low computational load and is able to detect and localize several types of network anomalies. We also assess the performance of the TopRank algorithm using synthetic data and compare it with alternative approaches based on random aggregation.},

The methods examined include the standard normal homogeneity (SNH) test, Wilcoxon's nonparametric test, two-phase regression (TPR) procedures, inhomogeneity tests, information criteria procedures, and various variants thereof. All of these methods have been proposed in the climate literature to detect undocumented changepoints, but heretofore there has been little formal comparison of the techniques on either real or simulated climate series. This study seeks to unify the topic, showing clearly the fundamental differences among the assumptions made by each procedure and providing guidelines for which procedures work best in different situations. It is shown that the common trend TPR and Sawa's Bayes criteria procedures seem optimal for most climate time series, whereas the SNH procedure and its nonparametric variant are probably best when trend and periodic effects can be diminished by using homogeneous reference series. Two applications to annual mean tem- perature series are given. Directions for future research are discussed.},

We study the worst case complexity of the algorithm when there is a unidimensional parameter per segment and demonstrate that it is at worst equivalent to the complexity of the segment neighbourhood algorithm: O(K max n 2). For a particular loss function we demonstrate that pruning is on average efficient even if there are no change-points in the signal.

abstract = {The scan statistic is by far the most popular method for anomaly detection, being popular in syndromic surveillance, signal and image processing, and target detection based on sensor networks, among other applications. The use of the scan statistics in such settings yields an hypothesis testing procedure, where the null hypothesis corresponds to the absence of anomalous behavior. If the null distribution is known, then calibration of a scan-based test is relatively easy, as it can be done by Monte-Carlo simulation. When the null distribution is unknown, it is less straightforward. We investigate two procedures. The first one is a calibration by permutation and the other is a rank-based scan test, which is distribution-free and less sensitive to outliers. Furthermore, the rank-scan test requires only a one-time calibration for a given data size making it computationally much more appealing. In both cases, we quantify the performance loss with respect to an oracle scan test that knows the null distribution. We show that using one of these calibration procedures results in only a very small loss of power in the context of a natural exponential family . This includes the classical normal location model, popular in signal processing, and the Poisson model, popular in syndromic surveillance. We perform numerical experiments on simulated data further supporting our theory and also on a real dataset from genomics.},

The asymptotic distributions of the tests depend on a trimming parameter $\epsilon$ and critical values were tabulated for $\epsilon$= 0.05. As discussed in Bai and Perron (2000), larger values of $\epsilon$ are needed to achieve tests with correct size in finite samples, when allowing for heterogeneity across segments or serial correlation in the errors. The aim of this paper is to supplement the set of critical values available with other values of $\epsilon$ to enable proper empirical applications.

The topics covered are: methods related to estimation and inference about break dates for single equations with or without restrictions, with extensions to multi-equations systems where allowance is also made for changes in the variability of the shocks; tests for structural changes including tests for a single or multiple changes and tests valid with unit root or trending regressors, and tests for changes in the trend function of a series that can be integrated or trendstationary; testing for a unit root versus trend-stationarity in the presence of structural changes in the trend function; testing for cointegration in the presence of structural changes; and issues related to long memory and level shifts. Our focus is on the conceptual issues about the frameworks adopted and the assumptions imposed as they relate to potential applicability.

abstract = {This paper considers issues related to estimation, inference, and computation with multiple structural changes that occur at unknown dates in a system of equations. Changes can occur in the regression coefficients and/or the covariance matrix of the errors. We also allow arbitrary restrictions on these parameters, which permits the analysis of partial structural change models, common breaks that occur in all equations, breaks that occur in a subset of equations, and so forth. The method of estimation is quasi-maximum likelihood based on Normal errors. The limiting distributions are obtained under more general assumptions than previous studies. For testing, we propose likelihood ratio type statistics to test the null hypothesis of no structural change and to select the number of changes. Structural change tests with restrictions on the parameters can be constructed to achieve higher power when prior information is present. For computation, an algorithm for an efficient procedure is proposed to construct the estimates and test statistics. We also introduce a novel locally ordered breaks model, which allows the breaks in different equations to be related yet not occurring at the same dates.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

In an application to EEG and respiratory data recorded from humans during afternoon naps, the obtained segmentations of the data agree with the sleep stage segmentation of a medical expert to a large extent. However, in contrast to the manual segmentation, our method does not require a priori knowledge about physiology. Moreover, it has a high temporal resolution and reveals previously unclassified details of the transitions. In particular, a parameter is found that is potentially helpful for vigilance monitoring.

The test is demonstrated on earthquake, explosion, infant electrocardiogram and simulated time series showing varying degrees of stationarity. The second main contribution develops approximate confidence intervals for time varying autocovariances for locally stationary series as the usual bands computed for stationary series are not appropriate.

The focuses of the approach are the modeling of in-sample structural breaks and forecasting time series allowing out-of-sample breaks. The model has several desirable features. First, the number of regimes is not fixed but is treated as a random variable. Second, the model adopts a hierarchical prior for regime coefficients, which allows for the coefficients of one regime to contain information about coefficients of other regimes. Third, the regime coefficients can be integrated analytically in the posterior density; as a consequence the posterior simulator is fast and reliable. An application to US real GDP quarterly growth rates links groups of regimes to specific historical periods and provides forecasts of future growth rates. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.},

abstract = {A great deal of effort has been devoted to reducing the risk of spurious scientific discoveries, from the use of sophisticated validation techniques, to deep statistical methods for controlling the false discovery rate in multiple hypothesis testing. However, there is a fundamental discon- nect between the theoretical results and the practice of data analysis: the theory of statistical inference assumes a fixed collection of hypotheses to be tested, or learning algorithms to be applied, selected non-adaptively before the data are gathered, whereas in practice data is shared and reused with hypotheses and new analyses being generated on the basis of data exploration and the outcomes of previous analyses. In this work we initiate a principled study of how to guarantee the validity of statistical inference in adaptive data analysis. As an instance of this problem, we propose and investigate the question of estimating the expectations of m adaptively chosen functions on an unknown distribution given n random samples. We show that, surprisingly, there is a way to estimate an exponential in n number of expectations accurately even if the functions are chosen adaptively. This gives an exponential improvement over standard empirical estimators that are limited to a linear number of estimates. Our result follows from a general technique that counter-intuitively involves actively perturbing and coordinating the estimates, using techniques developed for privacy preservation. We give additional applications of this technique to our question.},

A general scenario with multiple signals present at the same time is considered.

In this way the design of an eigenvalue-based detector is made conceptually identical to that of a traditional energy detector. As additional results, the paper discusses the conditions of signal identifiability for single and multiple sources. All the analytical results are validated through numerical simulations, covering also convergence, identifiabilty and non-Gaussian practical modulations.},

abstract = {The human figure exhibits complex and rich dynamic behavior that is both nonlinear and time-varying. Effective models of human dynamics can be learned from motion capture data using switching linear dynamic system (SLDS) models. We present results for human motion synthesis, classification, and visual tracking using learned SLDS models. Since ex- act inference in SLDS is intractable, we present three approximate inference algorithms and compare their performance. In particular, a new variational inference algorithm is obtained by casting the SLDS model as a Dynamic Bayesian Network. Classification experiments show the superiority of SLDS over conventionalHMM's for our problem domain.},

The tests apply to the class of ARCH and SV type processes as well as data-driven volatility estimators using high-frequency data. In addition to testing for the presence of breaks, the statistics identify the number and location of multiple breaks. We study the size and power of the new tests for detecting breaks in the conditional variance under various realistic univariate heteroscedastic models, change-point hypotheses and sampling schemes. The paper concludes with an empirical analysis using data from the stock and FX markets for which we find multiple breaks associated with the Asian and Russian financial crises. These events resulted in changes in the dynamics of volatility of asset returns in the samples prior and post the breaks. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

We present two distribution-free tests based on large deviation bounds for the MMD, and a third test based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic. The MMD can be computed in quadratic time, although efficient linear time approximations are available. Our statistic is an instance of an integral probability metric, and various classical metrics on distributions are obtained when alternative function classes are used in place of an RKHS. We apply our two-sample tests to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly. Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the retrospective or off-line multiple change-point detection problem. Multiple change-point models are here viewed as latent structure models and the focus is on inference concerning the latent segmentation space. Methods for exploring the space of possible segmentations of a sequence for a fixed number of change points may be divided into two categories: (i) enumeration of segmentations, (ii) summary of the possible segmentations in change-point or segment profiles. Concerning the first category, a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the top $\backslash${\$}\backslash{\$}N$\backslash${\$}\backslash{\$} N most probable segmentations is derived. Concerning the second category, a forward-backward dynamic programming algorithm and a smoothing-type forward-backward algorithm for computing two types of change-point and segment profiles are derived. The proposed methods are mainly useful for exploring the segmentation space for successive numbers of change points and provide a set of assessment tools for multiple change-point models that can be applied both in a non-Bayesian and a Bayesian framework. We show using examples that the proposed methods may help to compare alternative multiple change-point models (e.g. Gaussian model with piecewise constant variances or global variance), predict supplementary change points, highlight overestimation of the number of change points and summarize the uncertainty concerning the position of change points.},

As with most computer science problems, representation of the data is the key to efficient and effective solutions. One of the most commonly used representations is piecewise linear approximation. This representation has been used by various researchers to support clustering, classification, indexing and association rule mining of time-series data. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to obtain this representation, with several algorithms having been independently rediscovered several times. In this paper, we undertake the first extensive review and empirical comparison of all proposed techniques. We show that all these algorithms have fatal flaws from a data-mining perspective. We introduce a novel algorithm that we empirically show to be superior to all others in the literature.},

abstract = {Time series data are difficult to manipulate. When they can be transformed into meaningful symbols, it becomes an easy task to query and understand them. While most recent works in time series query only concentrate on how to identify a given pattern from a time series, they do not consider the problem of identifying a suitable set of time points based upon which the time series can be segmented in accordance with a given set of pattern templates, e.g., a set of technical analysis patterns for stock analysis. On the other hand, using fixed length segmentation is only a primitive approach to such kind of problem and hence a dynamic approach is preferred so that the time series can be segmented flexibly and effectively. In view of the fact that such a segmentation problem is actually an optimization problem and evolutionary computation is an appropriate tool to solve it, we propose an evolutionary segmentation algorithm in this paper. Encouraging experimental results in segmenting the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index using 22 technical analysis patterns are reported},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework for three-dimensional model-based tracking. Graphical rendering technology is combined with constrained active contour tracking to create a robust wire-frame tracking system. It operates in real time at video frame rate (25 Hz) on standard hardware. It is based on an internal CAD model of the object to be tracked which is rendered using a binary space partition tree to perform hidden line removal. The visible edge features are thus identified online at each frame and correspondences are found in the video feed. A Lie group formalism is used to cast the motion computation problem into simple geometric terms so that tracking becomes a simple optimization problem solved by means of iterative reweighted least squares. A visual servoing system constructed using this framework is presented together with results showing the accuracy of the tracker. The system also incorporates real-time online calibration of internal camera parameters. The paper then describes how this tracking system has been extended to provide a general framework for tracking in complex configurations, including the use of multiple cameras, the tracking of structures with articulated components, or of multiple structures with constraints. The methodology used to achieve this exploits the simple geometric nature of the Lie group formalism which renders the constraints linear and homogeneous. The adjoint representation of the group is used to transform measurements into common coordinate frames. The constraints are then imposed by means of Lagrange multipliers. Results from a number of experiments performed using this framework are presented and discussed.},

Our key idea is to estimate the ratio of probability densities, not the probability densities them- selves. This formulation allows us to avoid non-parametric density estimation, which is known to be a difficult prob- lem. We provide a change-point detection algorithm based on direct density-ratio estimation that can be computed very efficiently in an online manner.

@article{Davidson1987,
abstract = {The local power of test statistics is analyzed by extending the notion of Pitman sequences to sequences of data-generating processes (DGP's) that approach the null hypothesis without necessarily satisfying the alternative. A space of probability densities is defined and endowed with the structure of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert manifold, which permits a geometrical interpretation of hypothesis testing. The three classical test statistics-LR, Wald, and LM-are shown to tend asymptotically to the same random variable under all sequences of local DGP's. The power of these statistics is seen to depend on the null, the alternative, and the sequence of DGP's in a simple and geometrically intuitive way. Moreover, for any test statistic that is asymptotically chi-squared under the null, there exists an "implicit alternative hypothesis" against which that statistic will have highest power, and which coincides with the explicit alternative for the classical test statistics.},

@article{E.Brodsky1999,
abstract = {A new method for segmentation of the EEG, based on a nonparametric statistical analysis, is proposed. A nonparametric approach was chosen because it minimises the need for a priori information about a signal. The method provides detection of change-points (quasi-stationary segments' boundaries) in almost any EEG characteristic for a given level of false alarm probability. The method was applied to 8-channels spontaneous EEG recordings obtained from 12 subjects in eyes closed and eyes open conditions to detect rapid fluctuations of the alpha rhythm power. After preliminary adjustment of false alarm probability values all the recordings were analysed in unsupervised regime with the same parameters. From 15 to 1 19 change-points were found per minute and EEG channel. Automatically detected change-points were in good correspondence with visual estimation of the instants of change in alpha activity.},

@article{Azami2014,
abstract = {In numerous signal processing applications, non-stationary signals should be segmented to piece-wise stationary epochs before being further analyzed. In this article, an enhanced segmentation method based on fractal dimension (FD) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for non-stationary signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalogram (MEG) and electromyogram (EMG), is proposed. In the proposed approach, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the signal into orthonormal time series with different frequency bands. Then, the FD of the decomposed signal is calculated within two sliding windows. The accuracy of the segmentation method depends on these parameters of FD. In this study, four EAs are used to increase the accuracy of segmentation method and choose acceptable parameters of the FD. These include particle swarm optimization (PSO), new PSO (NPSO), PSO with mutation, and bee colony optimization (BCO). The suggested methods are compared with other most popular approaches (improved nonlinear energy operator (INLEO), wavelet generalized likelihood ratio (WGLR), and Varri's method) using synthetic signals, real EEG data, and the difference in the received photons of galactic objects. The results demonstrate the absolute superiority of the suggested approach. ?? 2014.},

A general yet structuring methodological strategy is adopted to organize this vast body of work. More precisely, detection algorithms considered in this review are characterized by three elements: a cost function, a search method and a constraint on the number of changes. Each of those elements is described, reviewed and discussed separately. Implementations of the main algorithms described in this article are provided within a Python package called ruptures.},
