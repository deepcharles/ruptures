    "# Graph signals change point detection with the Graph Fourier Scan Statistic: a low-pass band filter\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph signal processing (GSP) is the study of multivariate signals $y_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ lying on the nodes of a graph $\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}, \\mathcal{W})$ (see for instance [[Stankovic2019](#Stankovic2019), [Shuman2013](#Shuman2013)]). As in standard signal processing, it is possible to define a Graph Fourier Transform and to generalize the notion of spectral filtering. The intuition behind the graph spectral frequencies is that a signal whose (graph) spectrum is located at low frequencies is \"smoother\" than a signal whose energy is concentrated on high frequencies. By \"smoother\", we refer to the notion of smoothness with respect to the structure of the graph [[Shuman2013](#Shuman2013)]: the smoother a signal, the closer its values on neighbor nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, by applying a low-pass filter on the graph spectral domain, one is likely to remove from a graph signal the noise and/or uncorrelated information across the nodes. The authors of [[Ferrari2019](#Ferrari2019)] leverage this idea to define the Graph Fourier Scan Statistic (GFSS) algorithm (derived from the statistic introduced in [[Sharpnack2016](#Sharpnack2016)]). When a graph structure is available, this is one possible way of using notions coming from the field of GSP to enhance change point detection (CPD) for multivariate signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we focus on the above approach and we show how to apply it with `ruptures`. This example relies on the class [CostGFSSL2](../user-guide/costs/costgfssl2.md), which results from the combination of the GFSS and the least squared deviation.\n"

    "As explained above, applying a low-pass filter to a graph signal shrinks the high-frequency components, thus attenuating the signal components that are not smooth with respect to the graph structure. Based on this statement, we deduce two potential (related) benefits of applying the cost `CostGFSSL2`:\n",

    "1. *Scenario 1*: as in [[Ferrari2019](#Ferrari2019)], detecting mean changes that are localized on clusters of the graph only. Formally, let $e_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 I)$ a white noise process. If we denote $m_t(i)$ the mean of the process at node $i$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ a well connected subset of $\\mathcal{V}$ (a cluster), one may try to detect $t_r$ such that:\n",

    "We aim at detecting mean changes localized over one cluster only, as described in the scenario 1 presented in [the objectives](#objectives). Therefore, the generated signal undergoes a single mean-change over only one of the graph clusters, while it remains unchanged (in mean) over the other nodes. In this experiment, we progressively increase the noise level of the generated signal and we compare the change points that are detected by the standard [`CostL2`](../../user-guide/costs/costl2) and those obtained with the [`CostGFSSL`](../user-guide/costs/costgfssl2.md). We expect the GFSS filtering to increase the robustness of the change-point detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume to be in the most general case, namely as if we did not know the number of changes to be detected. In this framework, we use the [Pelt](../user-guide/detection/pelt.md) algorithm and we set the penalty coefficient $\\beta$ to an arbitrary constant such that the experiments we show are relevant. The rigorous calibration of this parameter would require more work but is not the topic of this example. \n",

    "The last parameter to be chosen is the cut-sparsity $\\rho$ used in the definition of the GFSS [[Sharpnack2016](#Sharpnack2016), [Ferrari2019](#Ferrari2019)]. Empirically, as this parameter acts as a frequency threshold, one should look at the eigenvalues (spatial frequencies) to get an idea for the magnitude of $\\rho$. For the relevancy of our two experiments we set: $\\beta = 500$ and $\\rho = \\lambda_1 / 2$ where $\\lambda_1$ is the first eigenvalue."
