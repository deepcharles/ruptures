    "# Graph signals change point detection with the Graph Fourier Scan Statistic: a low-pass band filter\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph signal processing (GSP) is the study of multivariate signals $y_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ lying on the nodes of a graph $\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}, \\mathcal{W})$ (see for instance [[Stankovic2019](#Stankovic2019), [Shuman2013](#Shuman2013)]). As in standard signal processing, it is possible to define a Graph Fourier Transform and to generalize the notion of spectral filtering. The intuition behind the graph spectral frequencies is that a signal whose (graph) spectrum is located at low frequencies is \"smoother\" than a signal whose energy is concentrated on high frequencies. By \"smoother\", we refer to the notion of smoothness with respect to the structure of the graph [[Shuman2013](#Shuman2013)]: the smoother a signal, the closer its values on neighbor nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, by applying a low-pass filter on the graph spectral domain, one is likely to remove from a graph signal the noise and/or uncorrelated information across the nodes. The authors of [[Ferrari2019](#Ferrari2019)] leverage this idea to define the Graph Fourier Scan Statistic (GFSS) algorithm (derived from the statistic introduced in [[Sharpnack2016](#Sharpnack2016)]). When a graph structure is available, this is one possible way of using notions coming from the field of GSP to enhance change point detection for multivariate signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we focus on the above approach and we show how to apply it with `ruptures`. This example relies on the class [CostGFSSL2](../user-guide/costs/costgfssl2.md), which results from the combination of the GFSS and the least squared deviation.\n"
