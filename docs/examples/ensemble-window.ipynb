    "# Changepoint Detection Ensembles: Window search method\n",

    "<!-- {{ add_binder_block(page) }} -->\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many changepoint detection (CPD) procedure can be implemented with `ruptures`. In most case, these procedures involve a search method relying on only one cost function. We are investigating here a way of building an ensemble model, on top of `ruptures` package, using the [window search method](../user-guide/detection/window.md) that will rely on several cost functions. The incentive for this approach is to combine the methods considering only one cost into an aggregated score. \n",
    "\n",
    "The interested reader can refer to [Katser2021](#Katser2021) for a more complete introduction. As in the paper, we will make the assumption that the number of changepoints to detect is known in advance."
