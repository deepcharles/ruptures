    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In `ruptures`, change point detection procedures make use of only one cost function.\n",
    "The choice of the cost function is critical as it is related to the type of change to find. \n",
    "For instance, [CostL2](../user-guide/costs/costl2.md) can detect shifts in the mean, [CostNormal](../user-guide/costs/costnormal.md) can detect shifts in the mean and the covariance structure, [CostAR](../user-guide/costs/costautoregressive.md) can detect shifts in the auto-regressive structure, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in many settings, several types of changes co-exist in the same signal and a single cost function is not able to spot all changes simultaneously.\n",
    "To cope with this issue, a procedure to merge several cost functions has been introduced [[Katser2021]](#Katser2021).\n",
    "In a nutshell, a number of costs can be combined to yield an aggregated cost function which is sensitive to several types of changes.\n",
    "The aggregated cost can then be used with any search method (such as the [window search method](../user-guide/detection/window.md)) to create change point detection algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates the aggregation procedure, also referred to as an ensemble model.\n",
    "Here, only [dynamic programming](../user-guide/detection/dynp.md) is considered, but all other search methods (e.g. [window sliding search method](../user-guide/detection/window.md), [PELT](../user-guide/detection/pelt.md), [binary segmentation](../user-guide/detection/binseg.md)) could be used.\n",
    "In addition, the number of changes is assumed to be known by the user.\n",
    "More details can be found in the original paper introducing the cost aggregation procedure [[Katser2021]](#Katser2021)."
