# ruptures

`ruptures` is a Python library for off-line change point detection.
This package provides methods for the analysis and segmentation of non-stationary signals.  Implemented algorithms include exact and approximate detection for various parametric and non-parametric models.
`ruptures` focuses on ease of use by providing a well-documented and consistent interface.
In addition, thanks to its modular structure, different algorithms and models can be connected and extended within this package.

# Dependencies and install

`ruptures` is tested to work under Python >= 3.4.
It is written in pure Python and depends on the following libraries: `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` (optional).

- With **pip**:
    > pip3 install ruptures

- With **conda**:
    > conda install -c conda-forge ruptures
   
- From source: download the archive and run from inside the **ruptures** directory:
    
    > python3 setup.py install
    
    or

    > python3 setup.py develop

# Basic usage

(Please refer to the [documentation](https://centre-borelli.github.io/ruptures-docs/ "Link to documentation") for more advanced use.)

The following snippet creates a noisy piecewise constant signal, performs a penalized kernel change point detection and displays the results (alternating colors mark true regimes and dashed lines mark estimated change points).

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import ruptures as rpt

# generate signal
n_samples, dim, sigma = 1000, 3, 4
n_bkps = 4  # number of breakpoints
signal, bkps = rpt.pw_constant(n_samples, dim, n_bkps, noise_std=sigma)

# detection
algo = rpt.Pelt(model="rbf").fit(signal)
result = algo.predict(pen=10)

# display
rpt.display(signal, bkps, result)
plt.show()
```
