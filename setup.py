Offline change point detection for Python.
------------------------------------------

**ruptures** is a Python library for offline change point detection. This package provides methods for the analysis and segmentation of non-stationary signals. Implemented algorithms include exact and approximate detection for various parametric and non-parametric models. **ruptures** focuses on ease of use by providing a well-documented and consistent interface. In addition, thanks to its modular structure, different algorithms and models can be connected and extended within this package.


An extensive documentation is available `github.com/deepcharles/ruptures <https://github.com/deepcharles/ruptures>`_.

This version requires Python 3 or later.
